I am doing some online calisthenics training (rings, dips, chin ups, splits, handstands kinda things) but I might need some help with the nutrition side as my coach is not plant-based. Iâ€™m keen to eat healthy (not just for gains etc). I am eating around 120-140g protein per day (Iâ€™m 57kg) from a range of PB sources. Is that the kind of thing you help with?"

That's exactly the kind of thing my online coaching helps with â€“ creating tailored meal plans to support your goals and training. Happy to explain how it works if you like?"
