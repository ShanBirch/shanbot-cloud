I ate pasta, pizza and wine every single day, and didn’t gained any weight, ha ha! 😍🍝🍕￼\n\nThanks for stopping by and saying hello. ￼🤗 + Shannon: Haha no weight gain in Italy - that's a win! What was your fave thing about Rome? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Honestly, it was a bit too touristy for me in most places, so I made it a point to wander as far away from the touristy areas as possible. But, I do love walking by the colosseum or other random ruins on a daily commute. I think that’s cool. The best part was my airbnb with a terrace that I found myself salsa dancing several nights I was there, but that’s not your typical Roman holiday. 🤷‍♀️😁\n\nHave you been?"
