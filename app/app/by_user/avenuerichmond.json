The candle is lit, and the flame is visible. Behind the candle, there's a small glass bottle with a cork stopper and a black candle lid, all sitting on a white tray. A gold candle snuffer is also on the tray, adding a touch of elegance to the scene. The background is soft and blurred, creating a calming and luxurious atmosphere.",
