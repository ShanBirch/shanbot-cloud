Whereabouts did you ride to over the weekend? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Went to London and ace cafe and also an island off the coast 😋 + Do you ride? + Shannon: Yeah for sure! Used to ride BMX heaps when I was younger hey! Island off the coast sounds epic, which one did you get to? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Ah I wish I’d done BMX stuff, I only got into bikes four years ago 😭\nDid you do stunt stuff? \nIt’s called hayling island it’s near the Isle of Wight 🙂‍↕️ + Shannon: Yeah for sure, got right into the freestyle stuff back then! Even toured doing shows haha. Hayling Island looks like a decent spot! {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Oh wow 🤩 \nNo way?? That’s awesome, what made you stop doing it? 😮\nYeh it’s a nice spot when the weather is decent being the uk and all 😂 + (lead inserted a photo, analysis failed) + Shannon: Haha yeah it was a blast hey! I had a crash in Broken Hill and busted myself up pretty good, so decided to chill out a bit haha.  UK weather can be a bit rough for riding sometimes hey?

I take it you’re not from the uk? \nAh a zx10 for now 😎 I’ll probably get a smaller one for track though + Shannon: Haha yeah it was a bit of a wake up call for sure! Nah not from the UK mate, Aussie here!  ZX10 hey that's a beast! What smaller one are you thinking of for the track? Lead : Ahh I’m so jealous, Australia must be amazing 🤩 + Maybe a ninja 450 or a zx6r + Shannon: Haha yeah all good now mate! Just figured it was time for a change hey. Ninja 450 or ZX6R for track, both solid choices! Any preference yet? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : No not really as I haven’t actually ridden either haha, mostly it will be about whichever is cheaper to run 😊 + Shannon: Yeah okay, makes sense about the cost! Both great bikes hey! They'd be pretty different to ride too I reckon.  Have you had a chance to see either of them in person and suss out the prices yet? Lead : To be perfectly honest I don’t think I’ve done enough research for it and I’m also considering a gsxr 600  ☺️ + It’s just finding the time 😭 + Shannon: Yeah finding the time for that research can be a mission hey! {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : So you’re a fitness instructor? 👀 + Shannon: Haha yeah that's right!
