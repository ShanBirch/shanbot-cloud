Shannon Birch: Yeah come in ! I'm not sure if nic is coming or not !
Shannon Birch: I'll set it up anyway and we will see!
Shannon Birch: Hey Helen Here's your review for the week!: )
Photos: Didn't see any new progress pics this week. No worries, but if you can, snapping some regularly is super helpful to see how far you've come visually!
Weight: Weight's trending down nicely! You're down 1kg! Amazing progress! Keep doing what you're doing! Make sure you weigh in weekly to keep the data consistent!
Food: Looks like protein is looking low on some days, try adding a protein bar as a snack each day, or even a quick protein shake with two scoops of protein powder. Calories are also low, we want to hit that 1400 mark. If you are struggling, maybe try eating earlier in the day!
Steps: Steps are up and down a bit, but some days you're crushing it with 24k steps! How about trying to consistently ‚Ä¶
Shannon Birch: Have an awesome day Helen! Your a blessing!! Very proud of you!
Helen Forster Coco's: Thanks coach üôèüèª
