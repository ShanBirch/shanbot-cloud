Josh is a legend, good on him for sending you my way mate.  Vego bulking is a fun challenge haha, definitely learning lots! Broken ribs sound rough, especially from footy. How's the recovery going now? Lead : It was 18 months ago so ribs are good. Just trying to juggle training time/motivation with work and being a dad of 2 young girls + Shannon: Yeah that juggle is real mate! Work and kids definitely make finding time tricky. What sort of training were you doing before things got hectic? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : We ran a Yoga studio here on the island so a bunch of yoga and breathwork and just odds and ends with bodyweight and surfing. Joined the gym when I broke my ribs so just been doing a bit of a mixture of what I guess could be considered 'functional'\nFocus on balance and building dad strength + Shannon: Haha 'dad strength' is the best kind! What does that involve for you right now? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : An eclectic mix of exercises using a bosu ball, kettle bells, Swiss ball, medicine balls and throwing in some box jumps, push ups and chin ups for good measure + Warm up with a km on the rowing machine and smash out half an hour or so exercis3 then cap it off with a sauna + Shannon: Oh yeah nice, sounds like a solid mix! How often are you getting to the gym with that routine? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Twice a week or so. Theres intention to get more in but its just the eternal juggle. Swapped today's out for a surf which is a nice option when you live coastal. \n\nOut of curiosity, what nutrition studies have you done? Anything plant based/vego focussed or just general nutrition info/courses?"

Do you get out riding much? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Oh all the time when the weather is good! I basically lived on the bike this weekend just gone \ud83d\ude02 + Shannon: Haha love that! Whereabouts did you ride to over the weekend? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Went to London and ace cafe and also an island off the coast \ud83d\ude0b + Do you ride? + Shannon: Yeah for sure! Used to ride BMX heaps when I was younger hey! Island off the coast sounds epic, which one did you get to? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Ah I wish I\u2019d done BMX stuff, I only got into bikes four years ago \ud83d\ude2d\nDid you do stunt stuff? \nIt\u2019s called hayling island it\u2019s near the Isle of Wight \ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2195\ufe0f + Shannon: Yeah for sure, got right into the freestyle stuff back then! Even toured doing shows haha. Hayling Island looks like a decent spot! {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Oh wow \ud83e\udd29 \nNo way?? That\u2019s awesome, what made you stop doing it? \ud83d\ude2e\nYeh it\u2019s a nice spot when the weather is decent being the uk and all \ud83d\ude02 + (lead inserted a photo, analysis failed) + Shannon: Haha yeah it was a blast hey! I had a crash in Broken Hill and busted myself up pretty good, so decided to chill out a bit haha.  UK weather can be a bit rough for riding sometimes hey? What Kawasaki are you rocking at the moment? Lead : Oh dang I\u2019m sorry to hear that \ud83e\udd7a that must have been a hard decision? + Yeh it\u2019s garbage weather here alot anyways! I take it you\u2019re not from the uk? \nAh a zx10 for now \ud83d\ude0e I\u2019ll probably get a smaller one for track though + Shannon: Haha yeah it was a bit of a wake up call for sure! Nah not from the UK mate, Aussie here!  ZX10 hey that's a beast! What smaller one are you thinking of for the track? Lead : Ahh I\u2019m so jealous, Australia must be amazing \ud83e\udd29 + Maybe a ninja 450 or a zx6r + Shannon: Haha yeah all good now mate! Just figured it was time for a change hey. Ninja 450 or ZX6R for track, both solid choices! Any preference yet? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : No not really as I haven\u2019t actually ridden either haha, mostly it will be about whichever is cheaper to run \ud83d\ude0a + Shannon: Yeah okay, makes sense about the cost! Both great bikes hey! They'd be pretty different to ride too I reckon.  Have you had a chance to see either of them in person and suss out the prices yet? Lead : To be perfectly honest I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done enough research for it and I\u2019m also considering a gsxr 600  \u263a\ufe0f + It\u2019s just finding the time \ud83d\ude2d + Shannon: Yeah finding the time for that research can be a mission hey! {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : So you\u2019re a fitness instructor? \ud83d\udc40 + Shannon: Haha yeah that's right! Coco's Connected is my online fitness biz. Are you into fitness yourself? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : That\u2019s awesome,how long have you been running that?\nAnd I was a lot more when I was younger, I used to run track and weight lift a bit! Now I mostly go bouldering but I do want to get back to a healthy routine \u263a\ufe0f + Shannon: Yeah cheers! Coco's Connected has been going for a few years now. Track and weights hey that's awesome!  Bouldering is cool too. Good on ya for wanting to get back to a healthy routine. What sort of stuff are you keen to get back into? Lead : Haha you\u2019re welcome :) + Yeh fitness is super important and I know the more I do now the better I will age especially when I\u2019m quite old + I wanna get back to lifting regularly and I\u2019d like to improve my back and core strength! + Shannon: Solid goals hey! Totally agree on the ageing thing, smart move focusing on lifting and core/back strength now.  That's exactly the stuff my online coaching helps build. Reckon you'd be open to trying a free 2 week trial to get back into a solid routine? Lead : Maybe at some point but I can\u2019t start now sadly + I gotta finish up my masters before I can think about anything else \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d"

Found as a kitten in a campground in Colorado + Shannon: Richmond and Everest, awesome names!  Rescues are the best hey! What are they like? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Thanks for allowing me to share. Animals are just the best! \nRichmond is a trail dog.

We do strength based classes mostly! What about you, do you train at a gym or at home? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : That\u2019s a tough question! \nI dance 3-4x a week and travel a lot for dance events. Cant get enough. \n\nHow long have you been coaching for? And I saw on your page that you\u2019re plant based? \ud83d\ude4c + Ok cool! \nI mainly train at home.

Cant get enough. \n\nHow long have you been coaching for? And I saw on your page that you\u2019re plant based? \ud83d\ude4c + Ok cool! \nI mainly train at home. But I\u2019m going to start coaching at a gym so I\u2019ll have access to more equipment. + Shannon: Yeah right plant based for life! Been coaching for over 10 years now haha. That's cool you gonna coach at a gym! What kinda gym? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : That\u2019s amazing! How beautiful to be helping others in their fitness journeys for so many years. \ud83d\ude4c \n\nThe gym I will be coaching at is a small boutique gym in the cities downtown area. + Shannon: Cheers! Yeah love it hey. Boutique gyms are cool, more personal usually. What style of coaching will you focus on? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Mainly one-on-one. Hopefully I have the opportunity to do some group classes too. + Shannon: Oh nice one on one coaching is awesome! Really get to know your clients! What are you most excited about with coaching? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Ya know, I used to be a personal trainer years ago. And I loved the relationships with my clients. Being a part of their journey meant a lot to me. I\u2019m excited to have another area of someone\u2019s health that I can help improve.\nAnd it will get me out of the kitchen here and there and into another community of amazing people. + What did you do before coaching? What got you down this path? + Shannon: Yeah right! So before coaching hey,  I was actually a bit of a chubby kid haha, always struggled with my weight growing up, especially being veggie and clueless about protein!  Then got into exercise and science and it just clicked. Totally agree about the client relationships tho, being part of their journey is awesome! Sounds like you're really passionate about that too which is rad! Lead : That\u2019s so cool you grew up eating a veg based diet tho. But once it clicks it\u2019s pretty amazing to start building a body. I\u2019m so glad you found what worked and used your own journey to now help others. Well done! \nI\u2019m excited to see where you grow from here. \n\nHonestly I was clueless about protein until very recently. \ud83d\ude48 \nIt only just clicked for me this year. + Shannon: Yeah right! What kinda coaching did you do before? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : I was a personal trainer for some private clients as well as  at a gym. All different ages and abilities. So I catered to each."
